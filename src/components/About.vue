                <p class="m-3">This website is the first graded project in the Full Stack Software Developer course offered by ed2go. Using the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue, and Bootstrap skills I have learned, I've built the front-end of a website called Play2Learn. This website includes 2 games, Anagram Hunt and Math Facts, that you can use to exercise your brain.</p>
                <p class="m-3">ed2go was founded in 1997 to provide quality education the fastest way possible â€” online. What began as an email correspondent program has grown into a leading online continuing education provider, reaching life - long learners in 50 states and more than 16 countries. We believe that anyone can learn, and we exist to empower lives through education.</p>
